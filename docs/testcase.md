Sure, here is the test case document for the `Board` class in a markdown table format:

| Test Case ID | Objective | Method | Input | Expected Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Verify if the board is reset to the initial state | `resetBoard()` | None | All pits and stores should be empty |
| 2 | Verify if stones are distributed correctly across pits | `distributeStones(int startingPoint)` | Starting point (pit index) | The number of stones in each pit after distribution should match the expected count |
| 3 | Verify if an exception is thrown when trying to distribute stones into an invalid pit | `distributeStones(int startingPoint)` | Invalid starting point (pit index) | `PitNotFoundException` |
| 4 | Verify if stones are correctly added to the player's store after distribution | `distributeStones(int startingPoint)` | Starting point (pit index) | The player's store should have the correct number of stones after distribution |
| 5 | Verify if stones are captured correctly | `captureStones(int stoppingPoint, Player player)` | Stopping point (pit index), Player object | The number of stones in the pit after capture should be zero, and the captured stones should be added to the player's store |
| 6 | Verify if a side is correctly identified as empty or not | `isSideEmpty(int sideStartPitNum)` | Starting pit number for a side | Returns true if a side is empty, false otherwise |
| 7 | Verify if players are correctly registered with the board | `registerPlayers(Player one, Player two)` | Player1 object, Player2 object | The players should be correctly associated with their respective stores |

Please note that these test cases are based on the provided test methods and may need to be adjusted based on the actual implementation of the methods in the `Board` class. Also, additional test cases may be needed to fully test all functionalities of the class.
