### Are the variable and method names meaningful and descriptive? Give specific examples to support your observation. How could the variable and method names be improved?
The method names are all the same as given into the program.  I think the names are descriptive and provide a good idea of what the method does. For example, "distributeStones" `Board.java` is a meaningful name because it tells you what the method does without needing a comment.  Regarding variable names, I think the variables were named well because going into deciphering the code it was clear what each variable was doing. A problem with the variable names however is soem of the paramaters have the same name as the instance variables.  This causes the method to hide the field of "name". Instead I would call the paramater "newName."  There are other methods like this such as "setStore. where you could rename the paramater to "newStore." Also I would rename the `getNumStones()` method in mancalaGame to `getBoardStoneCount` as it has the same name as a method in Board currently.

### Does the code follow coding conventions and formatting standards? Has it made appropriate use of includes? Are static members used properly? Give specific examples of how you would improve the coding conventions used.
 The code follows some coding conventions and formatting standards, such as using proper indentation and following Java naming conventions for classes and methods. However, there are some areas for improvement:

There is no use of JavaDoc comments to document classes and methods. Adding JavaDoc comments would make it easier for developers to understand the purpose of the classes and methods.
The code lacks comments within methods to explain complex logic. Comments should be added where necessary to clarify the code.
There is no error handling or validation in the code. It's important to handle potential exceptions or errors, and the code should include appropriate error messages or exceptions where needed.  For example, the comments could explain `setPlayers` in `MancalaGame`.

### Are the classes properly encapsulated? Are member variables private? Are accessor and mutator methods used? How could you improve the encapsulation of this code?
Member variables in most classes are private, which is good for encapsulation. Accessor and mutator methods (getters and setters) are used for member variables where needed, which is also good for encapsulation.
### Is there any duplication of code in this project? Are there methods that do essentially the same thing, or parts of the same thing that could be made into smaller methods?
There doesn't appear to be significant code duplication in the provided code. Each class seems to have a distinct purpose, and the methods are appropriately separated by their responsibilities.  There is a duplication in the names of methods however as `getNumStones()` is a method in `Board` and `MancalaGame`.


### Does each class and method have a single, obvious purpose or responsibility? Are there any long methods that should be broken up into smaller methods? Give specific examples of how you could improve the code with respect to responsibilities.
For the most part, the methods and classes are organized nicely and have a clear and obvious purpose.  One long method that I noticed was the start method in `TextUI` I felt that it should be broken up into it's responsibilities.  It could be separated into 3 methods such as: `printGameState`, `performGameMove`, `checkFowWinner`

The Board class is responsible for managing the game board, including pits and stores, which is appropriate. However, some methods, such as moveStones, distributeStones, and captureStonesare more complex methods and could use more descriptive comments. For example, `captureStones` could add the comment `// Capture stones when moving through the opponent's pits` and `distributeStone` could add `// Distribute stones across pits until number of stones hits zero`

The Store class  have a clear responsibility, managing the stones in a player's store.

The Pit and Player classes also have clear responsibilities related to pits and players, respectively.

In summary, the code can benefit from better organization and separation of responsibilities, especially in the MancalaGame and Board class. A

### Overall Functionality and Correctness
Personally I wanted to write more of the code myself because it helps me develop a deeper understanding of the code.  This is why I decided to ask `bingGPT` to write a very basic skeleton of the code with the AI just telling me what I should be writing in the methods instead of how I should be doing it.  The AI code still compiled, however I noticed a major mistake in the distributeStones method as it gave it the wrong paramaters and added two paramaters.  Luckily I had the JUNIT tests to run against it.  The basics of functionality is there however the code is super fragile and there is no error checking. For example, players can move pieces from their side or the opponents side and there is no check to see if they made a valid move.  It also never updates the player scores so the game will always result in a tie.  In addition the code does not take into account bonus turns or steals.  The user interface could also use a change to show the indexes of the pits above their pits.
